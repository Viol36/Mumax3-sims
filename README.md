# Spin Superfluid Simulations

This repository showcases micromagnetic simulations of magnetization dynamics in easy plane nanowires and rings.

Simulations were conducted using [MuMax3](https://mumax.github.io/), and analyzed using Python. Visualizations explore magnetization dynamics induced by spin current injection (driven by simulated spin torque). The effect of device parameters is explored with phase gradients.



## Topics Covered
- Spin current-driven magnetization dynamics
- Phase slips and winding number evolution
- Anisotropy and boundary effects

## Tools
- MuMax3
- Python, numpy, matplotlib
